# Evaluation Board
The first bit of hardware will be an evaluation board containing stereo pairs of a number of PDM microphones as well as a light sensor, a temp/humidity sensor, a couple different hall effect sensors, and some memory. Datasheets and EAGLE files will be in the evaluation_board folder.
